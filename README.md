# HighSellPrice
I added a red coin icon to the nameplates of nearby cities if the player has either non-food trade goods (any number), or food (more than 1 each), in their inventory with above average selling prices. Thus, players won't have to keep checking their inventory to see whether they have expensive trade goods to sell.

This mod requires Harmony.

It is safe to install and uninstall on an existing save.
